# Binary Search Tree
CSCI 362: Data Structures and Algorithms
Andy Jang

## Goal
The purpose of this program is to find a k-th smallest element using a binary search tree.

## How to run
Download the .zip file in the repository and extract all of the files. When using Linus or Git Bash, the program can be run with this command:  
`make run`
This should auto-compile the .cpp file and run it as well.  
When the program is run, it'll prompt for a K value, this is the k-th smallest element to find.
